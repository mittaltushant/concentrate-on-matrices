The talk is based on the paper, *From Poincaré inequalities to nonlinear matrix concentration* by De Huang and Joel A. Tropp, [arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16561).

## Abstract (from the paper)
> This paper deduces exponential matrix concentration from a Poincaré inequality via a short, conceptual argument. Among other examples, this theory applies to matrix-valued functions of a uniformly log-concave random vector. The proof relies on the subadditivity of Poincaré inequalities and a chain rule inequality for the trace of the matrix Dirichlet form. It also uses a symmetrization technique to avoid difficulties associated with a direct extension of the classic scalar argument.
